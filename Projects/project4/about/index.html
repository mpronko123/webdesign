			<div class="body"><p>I’ve been collecting elephant statues from before I could walk. I’ve always loved elephants and since I started collecting them I’ve obtained elephant figurines from all around the world. It doesn’t matter what they look like or what color they are, I like to have a variety to show off. Every elephant I collect is a different memory. I’ve always been very fasinated with elephants, they’re very interesting animals that are very different from any other animal. There’s always a saying that “elephants never forget” and I’ve always loved that saying because even us humans forget sometimes so for someone to say that an elephant never forgets that’s pretty impressive. Some fun facts about elephants that I enjoy are that their trunks are about 400 pounds and that the leader of a heard is usually the oldest female elephant.</p>
			<p>My first elephant  I ever recieved as a part of my collection was an elephant from Sri Lanka when I was a baby that my mom had gotten me. Its wooden and has a lot of different designs on it. When I was old enough to start adding to my collection myself, I would always look for elephant figurines wherever I went. In sixth grade I visited Greece and I bought a little gold elephant. Since I lived overseas, I was able to travel around the world a lot and collect elephants from different places I visited. My collection became something that my whole family would help with, my brother would go somewhere on a school trip and come back with an elephant for my collection from wherever he visited. </p></div>
